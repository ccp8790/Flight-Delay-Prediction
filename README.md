# Flight-Delay-Prediction

Flight delays could disrupt air passengers' schedules and cause a reduction in efficiency as capital costs increase and flight crews and airplanes are relocated. In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict whether a flight is going to delay more than 15 minutes. A delay forecasting can help companies create action plans to reduce the impacts of the delays.
